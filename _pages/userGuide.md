## Beginning

{% include figure image_path="/assets/images/interaactionScene.png" alt="InteraactionScene" caption="This is what InteraactionScene looks like on the 1st connection" %}

### Add scene

To add a scene, you must click on the "Scene" button with a black "+" surrounded by a black circle at the top left of the screen.

{% include figure image_path="/assets/images/userGuideImagesEN/sceneButton.png" alt="Scene button" %}

A window will open asking :

* The name of your scene
* The name of your image
* And finally the image you want to add

{% include figure image_path="/assets/images/userGuideImagesEN/windowAddScene.png" alt="Window add a scene" %}

In my example below, I want to create a scene whose name is "Lac" and the image of Lake Guéry.

{% include figure image_path="/assets/images/userGuideImagesEN/exampleAddScene.png" alt="Example add a scene" %}

I validate and this is what I get :

{% include figure image_path="/assets/images/userGuideImagesEN/exampleScene.png" alt="Example of a scene" caption="My 'Lac' scene with the Guéry lake as an image has been created." %}

### Add image

To add an image, you need at least one scene otherwise the button to add an image will not be available.<br />
Once you have a scene, you have to click on the "Image" button with a black "+" surrounded by a black circle to the right of the button that allows you to add a scene.

{% include figure image_path="/assets/images/userGuideImagesEN/imageButton.png" alt="Image button" %}

A window will open asking :

* The name of your image
* And finally the image you want to add

{% include figure image_path="/assets/images/userGuideImagesEN/windowAddImage.png" alt="Window add an image" %}

In my example below, I want to add another image to my "Lac" scene, that of Laffrey lake.

{% include figure image_path="/assets/images/userGuideImagesEN/exampleAddImage.png" alt="Example add an image" %}

I validate and this is what I get:

{% include figure image_path="/assets/images/userGuideImagesEN/exampleImage.png" alt="Example image" %}

My new image of Lac de Laffrey has been added to my "Lac" scene. This now contains my 2 images.

## Button "Play"

{% include figure image_path="/assets/images/userGuideImagesEN/playButton.png" alt="Play button" caption="This button allows you to play the sound associated with the hotspot when you click on it." %}

## Button "Manage Hotspots"

{% include figure image_path="/assets/images/userGuideImagesEN/manageHotspotsButton.png" alt="Manage hotspots button" caption="This button is used to manage the hotspots of our images." %}

Once you have clicked on it, 3 new buttons appear and allow:

* To add a hotspot to an image.
* To modify a hotspot of an image.

### Add hotspot

To add a hotspot to our image, click on the "Add Hotspot" button.

{% include figure image_path="/assets/images/userGuideImagesEN/addHotspotButton.png" alt="Add hotspot button" %}

Then click on the image, and while keeping the click pressed, trace the entire area that you want to define as a hotspot.

{% include figure image_path="/assets/images/userGuideImagesEN/zoneHotspot.png" alt="Hotspot area" caption="The black line and the darkened area in the image represent my hotspot." %}

Once the click is released, a window appears asking:

* If you want to import a sound or record a sound via the microphone of our PC.
* Choose the color of the hotspot: black (default), white, blue, red, orange or green.
* To give a name to our hotspot.

{% include figure image_path="/assets/images/userGuideImagesEN/windowAddHotspot.png" alt="Window add hotspot" %}

In my example below, I want to add a water sound for Lake Guéry.<br />
So I import a file "eau.mp3" which makes the sound of water.<br />
I choose to put the color of my hotspot in blue.<br />
And as a name, I choose "Water from the lake".

{% include figure image_path="/assets/images/userGuideImagesEN/exampleWindowAddHotspot.png" alt="Example window add hotspot fulfilled" %}

And this is what I get:
