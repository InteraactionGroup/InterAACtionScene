## Beginning

{% include figure image_path="/assets/images/userGuideImages/interaactionScene.png" alt="" caption="This is what InteraactionScene looks like on the 1st connection" %}

### Add scene

To add a scene, you must click on the "Scene" button with a black "+" surrounded by a black circle at the top left of the screen.

{% include figure image_path="/assets/images/userGuideImages/sceneButton.png" alt="" %}

A window will open asking:

* The name of your scene
* The name of your image
* And finally the image you want to add

{% include figure image_path="/assets/images/userGuideImages/windowAddScene.png" alt="" %}

In my example below, I want to create a scene whose name is "Lac" and the image of Lake Guéry.

{% include figure image_path="/assets/images/userGuideImages/exampleAddScene.png" alt="" %}

I validate and this is what I get:

{% include figure image_path="/assets/images/userGuideImages/exampleScene.png" alt="" caption="My "Lac" scene with the Guéry lake as an image has been created." %}

### Add image

To add an image, you need at least one scene otherwise the button to add an image will not be available. <br>
Once you have a scene, you have to click on the "Image" button with a black "+" surrounded by a black circle to the right of the button that allows you to add a scene.

{% include figure image_path="/assets/images/userGuideImages/imageButton.png" alt="" %}

A window will open asking:

* The name of your image
* And finally the image you want to add

{% include figure image_path="/assets/images/userGuideImages/windowAddImage.png" alt="" %}

In my example below, I want to add another image to my "Lac" scene, that of Laffrey lake.

{% include figure image_path="/assets/images/userGuideImages/exampleAddImage.png" alt="" %}

I validate and this is what I get:

{% include figure image_path="/assets/images/userGuideImages/exampleImage.png" alt="" %}

My new image of Lac de Laffrey has been added to my "Lac" scene. This now contains my 2 images.

## Button "Play"

{% include figure image_path="/assets/images/userGuideImages/playButton.png" alt="" caption="This button allows you to play the sound associated with the hotspot when you click on it." %}

## Button "Manage Hotspots"

{% include figure image_path="/assets/images/userGuideImages/manageHotspotsButton.png" alt="" caption="This button is used to manage the hotspots of our images." %}

Once you have clicked on it, 3 new buttons appear and allow:

* To add a hotspot to an image.
* To modify a hotspot of an image.
* To remove a hotspot from an image.

{% include figure image_path="/assets/images/userGuideImages/buttonsManageHotspots.png" alt="" %}

### Add hotspot

To add a hotspot to our image, click on the "Add Hotspot" button.

{% include figure image_path="/assets/images/userGuideImages/addHotspotButton.png" alt="" %}

Then click on the image, and while keeping the click pressed, trace the entire area that you want to define as a hotspot.

{% include figure image_path="/assets/images/userGuideImages/zoneHotspot.png" alt="" caption="The black line and the darkened area in the image represent my hotspot." %}

Once the click is released, a window appears asking:

* If you want to import a sound or record a sound via the microphone of our PC.
* Choose the color of the hotspot: black (default), white, blue, red, orange or green.
* To give a name to our hotspot.

{% include figure image_path="/assets/images/userGuideImages/windowAddHotspot.png" alt="" %}

In my example below, I want to add a water sound for Lake Guéry. <br>
So I import a file "eau.mp3" which makes the sound of water. <br>
I choose to put the color of my hotspot in blue. <br>
And as a name, I choose "Water from the lake".

{% include figure image_path="/assets/images/userGuideImages/exampleWindowAddHotspot.png" alt="" %}

And this is what I get:

{% include figure image_path="/assets/images/userGuideImages/zoneHotspot.png" alt="" caption="Now when we click on this hotspot it will make the noise associated with the sound we have chosen (water for me)." %}
